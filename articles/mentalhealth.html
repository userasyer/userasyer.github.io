			<p align="justify" class="introPara">
				&emsp;Hi everyone, I am Asyraf and I love modern art. Modern art
				enables people to creatively express their feelings or shine
				the spotlight towards issues in society. Now as for the
				reason I mentioned my affinity towards modern art has to do
				with media representation of mental health issues.
				<br><br>
				&emsp;I reckon that most of us have watched some form of media
				representation of mental health issues, be it in bad taste
				or genuine. Now when talking about media representing mental
				health issue, especially schizophrenia or DID, I can bet
				most people would mention movie names, as those are the most
				popular form of media representation we have in the current century.
				<br><br>
				&emsp;But have you encountered indie media's representation of
				mental health issue? One I could think of is the song Baby
				Hotline by Jack Stauber. It is a short song with lyrics that
				might seem random to first-time listeners, but with further
				interpretation, one could see the subtle meaning behind all
				the symbolisms of Stauber's words. The main theme of Baby
				Hotline is depression and anxiety, among other issues in the
				current society. One part in the song that says “Baby
				flatline, still time to do it too” is an eerie yet real
				representation of somebody struggling with depression
				contemplating their suicidal thoughts.
				<br><br>
				&emsp;For centuries, art has been one of the most powerful ways
				people tell stories and express their feelings. Art pieces
				like At Eternity’s Gate by Vincent Van Gogh, Yer Blues by
				the Beatles and Baby Hotline by Jack Stauber are examples
				of art being used to ignite discussion among society
				regarding mental health issues.
				<br><br>
				&emsp;As for depression, while some people might find media
				representations inaccurate or exaggerated in nature, there
				are some positive takeaways from the way art represents
				this mental health problem. As people encounter and
				appreciate these forms of artistic expression, they would be
				more likely to then educate themselves regarding the causes,
				symptoms and treatments of depression. For instance, Norwich
				City FC’s “You Are Not Alone” video campaign sparked
				awareness among fans and beyond on men’s mental health
				struggles. This shows that using art in a way that intrigues
				people could help society understand more on things often
				overlooked.
				<br><br>
				&emsp;To conclude, I think media has been one of the driving
				forces of societal progress especially when it comes to
				informing the mass regarding issues that are silently
				plaguing communities around the world. I hope that more
				artistic expression of mental health issues will be
				popularised and discussed about to help the public
				understand and eradicate prejudice towards people struggling
				with it.
