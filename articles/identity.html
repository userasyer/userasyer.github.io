		<p align="justify" style="margin: 0% 5% 0% 5%; text-align: center;">
			This blog is written by each of our group members regarding the
			assignment about how this school shaped our identity. Referring
			to the 3 materials that we studied, we are able to relate them with
			those real life situations, whose main purpose is to prioritize education
			and apply it in daily life. Each of us has shared our own personal
			reflection on how the school experiences shaped our identities today.

			I study at Kolej MARA Banting, world school that offers the International
			Baccalaureate (IB) programme to the students. As an IB student, I am
			encouraged by the school to develop the attributes of the IB Learner Profile
			which is valued by IB World Schools  such as being open-minded, caring and
			risk-takers. My school focuses on helping their students' holistic growth
			which means nurturing not only our academics abilities but also our emotional,
			social and personal development.
			<br><br>
			The school also managed to create a supportive environment where student can
			be confident and express their feelings freely. Teachers will always motivates
			us to take risks in learning, become an active member in a community and learn
			how to have a communication skills with others. This positive atmosphere allows
			us to grow into independent individuals who are ready to face all the challenges
			both inside and outside the classroom.

			&emsp;My time at Kolej MARA Banting has taught me how to balance independence
			and collaboration. When I first arrived, I was shy and unsure of myself.
			However, the supportive lecturers and group-based projects encouraged me
			to speak up and trust my ideas. Studying at Kolej MARA Banting has
			shaped my identity as an independent, resilient, and empathetic learner.
			The rigorous environment taught me to manage challenges on my own, while
			the diverse community reminded me that everyone's journey is unique and
			valuable.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;Malala Yousafzai's story taught me that education is a form of
			strength and freedom. Her courage to continue learning despite facing
			violence reminded me how powerful the pursuit of knowledge can be. At
			Kolej MARA Banting, I may not face the same dangers she did, but I've
			learned to appreciate the privilege of education in my own way. The
			demanding environment, endless assignments, and high expectations often
			challenge me but they also push me to grow stronger and more determined.
			Like Malala, I've come to see learning as more than just a path to good
			grades; it is a way to shape who I am and how I think. Her story inspires
			me to use my education to create change, no matter how small, whether it's
			helping others, sharing knowledge, or simply believing that my voice matters.
			Through this, my school has helped me build an identity rooted in courage,
			perseverance, and a deep respect for learning.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;Salma Pérez's story about her indigenous school in Los Angeles made me reflect
			on how my own school shaped my identity. Her experience showed how powerful
			it is when education embraces and celebrates who we are. At Kolej MARA Banting,
			I may not have been surrounded by lessons on cultural heritage like Salma
			was, but my school still taught me to value my identity in different ways.
			Through its challenging academic system and diverse community, I learned to appreciate
			my own strengths and to respect others' backgrounds and stories. Like
			Salma, I realized that education is more than textbooks and grades but
			it's about understanding who we are, where we come from and what we stand
			for. My school encouraged me to be confident in my goals and proud of my
			individuality, reminding me that growth begins when we learn to embrace our true
			selves.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;The movie Freedom Writers taught me the importance of compassion
			and perseverance in education. It showed how one teacher's belief in her
			students could completely transform their lives. Watching Erin Gruwell guide
			her class of at-risk teenagers reminded me of the teachers at Kolej MARA Banting
			who constantly motivate us to reach our full potential, even when things feel
			overwhelming. Like the students in the movie, I've learned that education
			isn't only about lessons and exams but, it's about discovering our own
			voices and learning to understand others. Being surrounded by classmates
			from different backgrounds has taught me empathy and respect, while our
			lecturers' dedication reminds me that belief and encouragement can change
			a person's path. Freedom Writers inspired me to see learning as a journey
			of self-discovery and connection, just as my school continues to shape me
			into someone stronger, more aware, and more hopeful about the future.

			&emsp;Kolej Mara Banting has played a significant role in shaping my identity
			today. It has helped me to be thoughtful, brave and confident learner.
			When I read I Am Malala for the first time, I was amazed by Malala Yousafzai's
			courage to fight for women's education. She shows few traits on the IB
			Learner Profile, which are risk-taker and principled in the story. Her
			story made me appreciate how lucky I am to be given a chance to study
			freely and also encouraged me to speak more confidently and not need
			to be shy in class or any group assignments.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;On the other hand, I also learned that being open-minded and having
			cultural understanding is important in my school. This is due to the
			students coming from diverse cultural backgrounds from all over Malaysia.
			My school showed their support for intercultural understanding by organizing
			events like collaborative projects and various cultural festivals. This
			relates to Salma's article, in which she learned how to balance tradition
			with personal goals. These activities help us to see the world from other
			perspectives and prevent us from becoming racist or judgmental.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;The movie Freedom Writers highlighted the importance of being caring and
			communicating. Ms. Gruwell's empathy towards her student had shown how
			kindness and communication can heal one another by looking at her student's
			transformation. Similar to what I've experienced here, my teachers have
			always encouraged me and my classmates to share our thoughts openly and
			support us. This has helped me realise that building positive relationships
			with those around you can lead to a better educational environment while
			encouraging a strong sense of belonging and purpose.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;Through these lessons, my school has helped me to develop several attributes
			of the IB Learner Profile, which are essential traits for me to have as an
			IB student. I have changed to someone who loves to learn, a thinker who
			solves problems thoughtfully and a reflective person who learns from past experience.

			&emsp;Wherever we go, we are subconsciously constructing our own life story. Being in college
			is one of the situations where we are constantly changing and even observing changes. The
			hustle and bustle of college life impact the way we think and also influences how we view
			ourselves. When I first walked through the gates of my college, I thought I had a vivid vision
			of who I will become in the future. I could clearly picture myself becoming someone in the
			computer world, having a career tied very close to the industry. But as things progressed,
			I have realised that I can be more than that. Not only do I learn about science, language
			and maths, but I also learn about something very important in life; being myself.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;As everybody does when they go to college, I get to know people from backgrounds
			that vary wildly. It turns out that you don't have to go too far out of the country to
			discover different mindsets, customs and traditions. People were often curious about things
			that I do different, things that I consider to be normal and that is completely okay because
			knowing each other is a part of building empathy and understanding. Empathy is what makes us
			human, I personally believe it is a big part of our identity as different communities might
			have different views on what is meant by “empathy.” Getting to know about my friends, their
			struggles, cultures and what they are proud of enables me to understand that identity is
			something you build as you face the ever-changing world.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;I often think of Salma Perez who wrote about how her indigenous school in Los Angeles
			celebrated her Zapoteca and Mixteca heritage. Her story brings a message about affirming
			who she was. In relation to my situation, I find Perez’s story to resonate with me as a
			student in a place where the majority of others do not even know about my culture. Seeing
			other friends taking pride with their roots also encouraged me to not feel inferior, and
			to instead affirm my identity.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;To affirm my identity isn't always easy, sometimes I feel misunderstood. Despite so,
			I have found that with courage and dedication, I can own my voice and let people know that
			I also matter in this place. I remember the first time I had to work in groups, as my
			classmates were still unfamiliar with each other, we had to break the barrier that makes
			us feel like we do not belong. I was very shy at the moment, and I had to gain the courage
			to start communicating in order to progress. We started to know each other and share about
			what we believe which helped us not only work together but also open our eyes to different
			angles of thinking. Reading I Am Malala reminded me that courage is not simply the absence
			of fear, but it is the determination to keep your head up even when the odds seem to be
			against you. My fear of communicating might seem minuscule when compared to Malala's fight
			for women’s right for education, but to some extent she was the inspiration for me to keep
			pushing myself to be a socially active.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;Lastly, let's talk about empathy, the thing I have mentioned from the beginning of
			this blog. Watching Freedom Writers hit me in the heart by showing how education bridges
			worlds that seemed very different. As Gruwell had inspired the students in the movie to
			write journals, I had also become inspired to start writing about new things I discover
			or feel in college. I and my close friends started sharing our own stories which opened
			up our eyes to the fact that in this college, everyone is fighting an invisible battle.
			This had definitely nurtured a sense of empathy in me.
			<br><br>
			&emsp;College did not just teach things that grant me a diploma, it educates me in
			subtle ways on how to be human. As Michael Stevens, an educational YouTuber said, "What
			makes us human is asking 'why?'" In the end, curiousity, empathy and courage are not only
			what lets us build our identity, but they are indeed part of what makes us who we are.
